# IMDB Top 250 SQL Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the 250 top rated IMDB movies of all time using some basic SQL queries.

This is my first project, mainly for the purpose of a starter portfolio project, as well as learning how to use Github to display future projects.

## Exploring the data

````SELECT * FROM imdb_top_250_movies ORDER BY year DESC````
